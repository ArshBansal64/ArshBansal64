## Featured Projects

### 🔹 [DotAsset](https://github.com/ArshBansal64/DotAsset) - LLM-Constrained Financial Data Analysis
A financial and demographic data analysis system that combines **probabilistic LLM reasoning** with **deterministic public APIs** to answer natural-language queries over U.S. Census data.  
Uses GPT as a constrained decision layer to select valid variables, geographies, and years before executing verified data fetches, reducing malformed requests and unsafe outputs.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, OpenAI API, U.S. Census API, Pandas

### 🔹 [FutureGram](https://github.com/ArshBansal64/FutureGram) - Time-Locked Social Platform
A mobile-first social platform built at **MadHacks** where posts become visible **only after a scheduled future date**, encouraging intentional sharing and anticipation.  
Led frontend development and integrated Firebase authentication and real-time syncing to support **100+ beta users** with minimal session errors.  
**Tech Stack:** React, JavaScript, Node.js, Firebase, Git
