Hi, I’m Arsh.

Recent CS+DS grad from UW–Madison. I’m interested in frontend and systems work, and I like building things where I can see the results, analyze them, then ship something even more impactful.

Pinned below are:
- A React social-media app with time-based "capsule" posts
- A Unix-style shell written in C
- An early-stage data platform combining LLMs with public datasets
